# 🏫 Smart Institute Website – MERN Stack

This is my first MERN project, built with the intention to **learn full-stack development**, **solve a real-world problem**, and create something that could offer **business value** in the future.

## 💡 Project Purpose

Most Bangladeshi educational institutions use outdated WordPress websites that:

- Are **not fully responsive**
- Rely on **static data** hardcoded in the frontend
- Require developers for every update
- Use **too many plugins** for simple features
- Charge **high prices** but offer poor UX for non-tech-savvy users

This project aims to **change that** by offering a solution that is:

- Fully dynamic and scalable
- Easy to manage even from a mobile phone
- Fast, responsive, and cleanly coded
- Simple and intuitive for non-technical admins
- Designed with scalability and modularity in mind

## ✨ Features (All Built from Scratch)

Everything shown on the **homepage** is **fully dynamic** and controlled from the **admin panel**:

✅ Dynamic headline (posted by institute) and institute code
✅ Responsive slideshow/banner images
✅ Admin-managed "About the Institute" section
✅ Admin-managed director/governing body sayings
✅ Notices – full create, update, delete functionality + detail view
✅ Admin-managed important links section
✅ Media gallery – add, update, delete images
✅ Central admin panel for all content management
✅ Fully responsive UI for both admin and public users

> 🔧 Only two additional pages are implemented:
>
> - `/notices` – View all notices
> - `/notices/:id` – View single notice details  
>   All other content is shown directly on the homepage for demonstration.
